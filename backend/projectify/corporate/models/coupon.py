Coupon model.

Coupons are used to help beta testers and other interested users sign
up for the Projectify application.

Sign up life cycle

1. Admin creates a coupon
2. Send coupon to user, including instructions on how to use it.
3. User signs up on Projectify, creates Workspace during onboarding
4. User goes to workspace billing settings and enters coupon.
5. Custom plan is unlocked for this workspace, with the available seats set
to the sign up code seats.
6. Coupon is marked as used and cannot be reused.

A coupon does not:

- Have an expiry date by which it needs to be used (for now at least)
- Assign an expiring plan to a customer. Seats will be available indefinitely
(for now at least)
- Constitute what we want to use for campaign or coupon codes in the future,
in order to offer rebates and special offers

    Store information about a coupon.

    The code can be used up by updating "used" with the current timestamp,
    and setting customer.

    NOTE: a deleted customer will set "customer" back to null, but it does not
    mean that this sign up code has not been used.

    The idea is that we want to avoid re-using coupons after a related customer
    has been deleted. We want to keep a permanent record of all coupons ever
    created. Deleting a coupon will make it difficult to keep
    a record.

    A coupon stores how many seats will be unlocked for a customer, when
    it is used for that customer.

    A coupon MUST not be usable twice, even for the same customer.

    A customer with a custom (coupon-activated) subscription MUST not be able
    to activate another coupon.
