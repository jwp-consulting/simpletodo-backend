# PostgreSQL workarounds

Here are some solutions for problems I have had with configuring PostgreSQL 13
and 15 so far.

## Use PostgreSQL with unix domain sockets

Referring to the
[dj-database-url documentation on URL schema](https://github.com/jazzband/dj-database-url?tab=readme-ov-file#url-schema),
we see that we can write unix domain socket paths like so:

```
postgres://%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fpostgresql/dbname
```

In our case, running PostgreSQL 15 installed through Nix on macOS, we see that
there is a socket in `/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432`. We therefore craft the following
link:

```
DATABASE_URL = postgres://%2Ftmp/projectify
```

## Creating a db after installing with MacPorts

Connecting is a big finicky, as you need to navigate away from your home dir
sub folder.

```
pushd /opt/local/lib/postgresql15; sudo -u postgres /opt/local/lib/postgresql15/bin/psql
```

## Psycopg2 installation with macports

Try this:

```
env PATH="/opt/local/lib/postgresql15/bin:$PATH" poetry install
```

## No user role

> psql: error: FATAL: role "$USER" does not exist

```
CREATE USER $USER WITH CREATEDB;
```

Make sure to run `createdb` if you'd like the bare `psql` command to work.

## Local password-less auth

**Note**: This was written with PostgreSQL 13 in mind.

> django.db.utils.OperationalError: fe_sendauth: no password supplied

 # replication privilege.
 local   replication     all                                     peer
```

## PostgreSQL started, but can't connect

Systemctl showed PostgreSQL 15 started, but `psql` couln't connect, not even as
`sudo -u postgres psql`:

```
psql: error: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting connections on that socket?
```

The solution: `/etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf` had this line that I
had to fix from

```
port = 5433                             # (change requires restart)
```

to

```
port = 5432                             # (change requires restart)
```

Remember to restart.

## Restarting PostgreSQL

Make sure to restart PostgreSQL, e.g. by running

```
sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service
```
