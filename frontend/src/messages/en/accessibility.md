# Accessibility goals

Projectify is committed to ensuring digital inclusivity and accessibility for
people with diverse disabilities. We are continually improving the user
experience for everyone, and applying the relevant accessibility standards.

We are also aiming to improve the use of both our website and platform for
users who employ assistive technologies.

# Measures we take to support accessibility

- Include accessibility as part of our mission statement
- Ensure designs meet a minimum accessibility level (WCAG 2.1 level AA)
- Compatibility with different web browsers and assistive technology
- Include people with disabilities in our user personas
- Conduct usability tests with people who have disabilities

# Conformance status

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standard defines requirements
to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels
of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. 'Fully conforms' means that
the content meets all of the WCAG requirements at the specified Level without
exceptions. Although our goal is WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance, we have also
applied some Level AAA Success Criteria: Images of text are only used for
decorative purposes.

Content posted since May 2022 fully conforms to WCAG 2.1 Level AA. It partially
conforms to Level AAA. Older content conforms to earlier versions of WCAG, for
example, WCAG 2.0.

# Compatibility with browsers and assistive technologies

The Projectify website and platform is designed to be compatible with assistive
technologies and the last two versions of major browsers. The website and
platform are not designed for Internet Explorer 11 and earlier versions.

# Platform

We are currently in the process of making our platform conform to accessibility
standards. Our main focus is to improve color contrast in both the light and
dark modes of our platform, increase discoverability of features for users with
vision impairments and enhance the usability of our main components.

# Website

- Keyboard navigation: All menus, buttons, inputs and actions are accessible
  from a keyboard.
- Screen reader compatibility: Our code supports the use of screen readers for
  users who digest information through audio means.
- Images: All images are supported with descriptive and accurate alternative
  text which can be read by screen readers.
- Text: Our text size, weight and font style have been carefully chosen to be
  accessible to users with dyslexia and/or visual impairment. WCAG 2.0 level AA
  requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large
  text.
- Color: WCAG 2.1 requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and
  user interface components, which we meet.
- Magnification: For sight impaired users, all pages and content can be
  magnified using standard browser controls or magnification software.

# Limitations
