# Billing settings

To edit your billing settings, go to the **Billing** tab in the workspace
settings. You can access the workspace settings by clicking **workspace
ellipsis button** (...) and clicking **Workspace settings** in the context
menu. From there select the **Billing** tab.

# Upgrading a trial workspace

To upgrade a trial workspace to a paid workspace, first select the number of
workspace seats you would like to add to your workspace using the **Workspace
seats** field.

Click the **Go to checkout button** and you will be redirected to a checkout
page where you can enter your payment details. The checkout page is implemented
using Stripe billing and Stripe will securely handle your payment information.

[trial workspace help page](/help/trial). To understand the differences between
a trial workspace and a paid workspace, please refer to the
[workspace quotas help page](/help/quota).
