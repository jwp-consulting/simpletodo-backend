# Filter and search by team member

You can filter and search team members that are part of your workspace by using
the **side menu**. Searching for team members helps you to find a team member
quickly and filtering by team member allows you to see tasks a certain team
member is working on.

You can apply more than one filter at a time. Go to the **Team members**
section in the side menu and from there you can search for team members, and
then filter by selecting them. You can also filter by tasks that have been
assigned to nobody by selecting **Assigned to nobody**.

Next to each team member's name you can also see the amount of tasks that have
been assigned to them. This is useful in determining which team team members
are available for new tasks to be assigned to them.

# Filter and search by label

You can filter and search labels that you have created in the **Filter labels**
section in the the **side menu**.

Searching for labels helps you to find a label quickly and filtering by label
allows you to see similar tasks at the same time.

You can apply more than one filter at a time. Click the label button in the
side menu and from there you can either search for a label or filter labels.

You can also search for tasks that have no label assigned to them by selected
**No label**.

# Search by keyword

The search box located on top of the project page gives you the ability to
further narrow down tasks. You can search tasks by:

- **Task number**
- **Task title**
- **Section title**

Enter your search terms in the field labeled **Task search** and search by
clicking **Search tasks**.

If no tasks have been found, you can reenter your search terms in the field
above. You can head back to the project page by clicking the **Go back to
project** link.
