# Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are available to use the Projectify dashboard more
efficiently. Keyboard shortcuts are different depending on whether you are
viewing a project or task. Refer to the corresponding section to find out what
keyboard shortcuts you can use.

# Project view shortcuts

The following shortscuts are accessible when viewing a project:

| Key to press |                      Action                       |
| :----------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |

# Task view shortcuts

No shortcuts are available right now for tasks. Do you have any requests for
keyboard shortcuts that you think will improve the usability of the task view?
