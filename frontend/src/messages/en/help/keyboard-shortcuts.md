# Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are available to use the Projectify dashboard more
efficiently. Keyboard shortcuts are different depending on whether you are
viewing a project or task. Refer to the corresponding section to find out what
keyboard shortcuts you can use.

Keyboard shortcuts are only avaible on a device with a keyboard or another
comparable input device. Some shortcuts rely on mouse interaction to be fully
usable.

# Project view shortcuts

The following shortscuts are accessible when viewing a project:

| Key to press | Action                                                        |
| :----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
|    **h**     | Select the previous section above the currently selected task |
|    **j**     | Select the next task below the currently selected task        |
|    **k**     | Select the previous task above the currently selected task    |
|    **l**     | Select the next section below the currently selected task     |

# Task view shortcuts

No shortcuts are available right now for tasks. Do you have any requests for
keyboard shortcuts that you think will improve the usability of the task view?
