# What are quotas

Depending on whether you have a paid workspace or a trial workspace, different
usage quotas will apply. Usage quotas determine how many items of a resouce you
can create within your workspace. Resources within your workspace are:

- Workspace users and invitations
- Workspace boards and sections
- Tasks and sub tasks
- Labels

# Quotas for paid workspaces

The only quota that applies to a paid workspace is how many workspace users you
can add and how many pending invites for new workspace users you have. These
two values are added together and compared with the number of seats you have
remaining in your workspace. For example, if you have a workspace with 10
seats, then

- if you have 8 workspace users and 1 pending invitation, you can invite or add
  one more workspace user
- if you have 8 workspace users and 2 pending invitations, you can not invite
  or add any more workspace users

If you would like to add more seats to your workspace, please review your
workspace billing settings in the dashboard. For more information on how to
change the billing settings, please refer to the [billing help](/help/billing).

# Quotas for trial workspaces

In a trial workspace, the following quotas apply:

- You can invite and add up to 1 additional workspace user, for a total of 2
  including yourself.
- You can create up to 10 workspace boards
- You can create up to 100 workspace board sections
- You can create up to 1000 tasks
- You can create up to 1000 sub tasks
- You can create up to 10 labels

If you would like to create more items, and invite more users to your
workspace, you can upgrade to a paid workspace from the workspace billing
settings. For more information on how to upgrade to paid workspace, please
refer to the [billing help](/help/billing).
