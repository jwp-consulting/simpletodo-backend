# Create a task

Tasks are the backbone of Projectify. In order to create a task simply click the + (plus) icon in a section panel. If you do not know how to create a section, please see the help page on sections. Another way of creating a task is to click the ellipsis button in the section panel, then click on 'Add a new task'

# Add context to a task

Context could be in the form of a title, description, label, assignee or due date. You have the freedom to add as little or as much context as you want, however we require having a title at the very least. When you create a task, an input form allows you to input information about the task.

# Edit a task

Once a task has been saved, you can go back in and edit the task by click the task. This will open up the same menu mentioned in the previous section above. You can also open this page with the task ellipsis button on the far right. Click in each field to edit the content you previously entered and once youre done, dont forget to save your work!

# Move a task

There are a few ways you can move a task as well as a few places. You can move your tasks around inside the section they are housed in as well as move them to other sections in your workspace board. For example, if you have a section called 'To Do' and another section called 'In Progress', you can move tasks between these sections. Moving tasks is simple. On the right of a task are three buttons. An up button, a down button and an ellipsis (three dots) button. The up and down buttons move the task inside the workpace board section. The ellipsis button allows you to select a section to move the task to, as well as more actions inside the current section such as 'Move to top' and 'Move to bottom'.

# Delete a task

In order to delete a task, click the ellipsis button in the task card and select 'Delete task' from the dropdown. This will open an overlay for you to confirm your choice to delete this task.
