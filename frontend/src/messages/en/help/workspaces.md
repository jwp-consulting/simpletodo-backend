# Create a workspace

When you make an account with the Projectify app you will automatically have
one workspace created for you as part of the onboarding.

To create more workspaces [visit this URL](/onboarding/new-workspace). Go
through the onboarding process there one more time to create a new workspace.

# Switch workspaces

To switch between workspaces, click the **workspace dropdown** in the side
menu. This will open up a context menu where you can switch between different
workspaces associated with your account. The workspace dropdown is the topmost
in the side menu.

# Workspace settings

To go to **workspace settings**, click the **workspace ellipsis button** (...)
next to the **workspace dropdown button** button in the side menu. This will
open up a context menu where you can access the current workspaces settings
page.

The workspace settings consist of four pages:

- **General**,
- **Team members**,
- **Billing**, and
- **Quota**,

**General** provides information on your current workspace such as the name of
the workspace. **Team members** allows you to add, edit permissions and delete
team members. **Billing** provides a way for you to amend your account billing
details. **Quota** shows you how many more items you can create in your
Projectify workspace.

To learn more about the team members page, visit the [team members
help](/help/team-members).

To learn more about the billing page, visit the [billing help](/help/billing).

To learn more about the quota page, visit the [workspace quota
help](/help/quota).
