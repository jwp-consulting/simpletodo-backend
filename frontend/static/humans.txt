Projectify
==========

Projectify is made by JWP Consulting GK, here in Setagaya City, Tokyo.

JWP Consulting GK is just me at the moment, but over time some awesome people
have helped with this project.

This all started as an attempt to remake Wunderlist. Over time I realized that
remaking Wunderlist is only part of the equation. The whole issue is that apps
come and go, with us left to clean up the mess and flee from platform to
platform.

What if an online service could make itself redundant, handing users back the
keys to their digital self?

THANKS

(from my MVP Isaac Newton)

First things first: This project would have never been possible without the
countless, millions of volunteer hours by all the people who make free software
happen.

Life would be nothing without the friends you make along the way. Thanks go out
to:

* Noboru Nakagawa
* Giosu√® Russo
* Karim Marzouq
* Sean Winchester
* Saki

Would you like to join the project? Contact me: hello@jwpconsulting.net

Yours,

Justus W. Perlwitz
